There is a fair amount in the rest of the files to look at.  See the .diff file in the original Binned analysis repository for our additions, see how the additions are added and separate them out if they can.  For now let's just rename Function -> BinnedFunction to keep it clear where it came from.  Later we can get a better handle on what each function is left doing and we can rename them to something more sensible (for example Function -> BinnedFunction -> FindNormalizationOptions)

Once you see what code has been added see how those functions and variables are used inside the code in the binned analysis (located in binnedanalysis/anita3code/source/)

All header files SHOULD be done.  They are located in this project under /include/

When you finish a .c* file put it in this repository under /src/

It is not a bad idea to have multiple people hit the same file to double check our work.

 	- Can I get someone to double check that we can safely remove most of this file like I did?


Files left to do:
