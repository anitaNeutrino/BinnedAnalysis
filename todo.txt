There is a fair amount in the rest of the files to look at.  See the .diff file in the original Binned analysis repository for our additions, see how the additions are added and separate them out if they can.  For now let's just rename Function -> BinnedFunction to keep it clear where it came from.  Later we can get a better handle on what each function is left doing and we can rename them to something more sensible (for example Function -> BinnedFunction -> FindNormalizationOptions)

Once you see what code has been added see how those functions and variables are used inside the code in the binned analysis (located in binnedanalysis/anita3code/source/)

All header files SHOULD be done.  They are located in this project under /include/

When you finish a .c* file put it in this repository under /src/

It is not a bad idea to have multiple people hit the same file to double check our work.

Completed files:

AnalysisConfig.cc
 - done (Ian)
 	- Can I get someone to double check that we can safely remove most of this file like I did?

Files left to do:

Analyzer.cc
 - Uses a correlator object (defined in Correlator.h) called corr that is called in Analyzer.h as a private object.  Will we need to make a BinnedAnalyzer.h even though it will only inherit analyzer.h?
 - Not sure what is going on with TGraphAligned.  We add "const TGraphAligned* hilbert = wf->hilbertEnvelope();" at line 766.
 - The entire section between line 812 and 891 is added by us.
	- We call hilbertTransform() multiple times.  I don't know where this is defined, the FFTtools command is gethilbertTransform().  Probably from some library but we'll need to figure out which one so we know to include it.  There is a pretty big list of includes in this file.
	- Tmath looks like some root stuff.
	- GetN() looks to be from healpix?
	- pk2pk() likely means peak to peak but I can't find what library this is defined in.
	- thissnr, thatsnr, and othersnr seem redundant.  We only define them to then define snr1, snr2, and snr3 respectively.  Maybe just lose these lines and define snr1, snr2, and snr3 directly. Also can we give these more descriptive names while we are at this?

BedmapReader.cxx
 - Done (Ian)
 	- We only add a section of code at the end that only depends on a few variables within the original BedmapReader.cxx.  Since we are inheriting this class it should give us access to those finctions as part of inheritance.
 	- Again, someone please check this.

ResponseManager.cc
 - Done (Ian)
 	- No functional difference between our files and the original Anita files.  This file and the associated .h can be left out.
