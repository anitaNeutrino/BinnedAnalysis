# BinnedAnalysis
Repository for the binned analysis. 


to begin:

you want BinnedAnalysis to live in /path/to/BinnedAnalysis. then do:
```c++
cd /path/to
git clone https://github.com/anitaNeutrino/BinnedAnalysis.git
```


before making some changes:
```c++
cd /path/to/BinnedAnalysis

git pull
```
after making changes

```c++
git add *  (here * adds all files you changed, you can also just specify the file you want to push)

git commit -m "the commit message"

git push origin master
```

for now, pushing to master is OK, since we're building things up. once there is a working codebase, branching can happen.
